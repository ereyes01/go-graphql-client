# go-graphql-client
A GraphQL client implementation in Go. Supports authentication

Adapted this from some old code I had lying around. However, I googled and found [MachineBox's GraphQL Client](https://github.com/machinebox/graphql) 
and I ended up using that instead. You should, too, it's well done.
